Monopoly Go is a wildly popular mobile game that allows players to experience the classic board game Monopoly in a fun and interactive way. In this game, dice rolls are essential for advancing on the board, purchasing properties, and collecting rewards.

But what if we told you thereâ€™s a way to get unlimited free dice rolls on your iOS or Android device?

In this guide, weâ€™ll show you how to get free dice rolls in Monopoly Go, as well as reveal some tips and tricks to help you become the ultimate Monopoly Go player. Whether you're new to the game or an experienced player, this article will provide valuable insights that can help you enjoy the game to its fullest.

Understanding the Importance of Dice Rolls in Monopoly Go
Before we dive into the methods for getting unlimited dice rolls, it's important to understand why dice rolls are so essential in Monopoly Go. Dice rolls serve as your primary means of moving around the board. Each time you roll the dice, you move a number of spaces equal to the value shown on the dice. The farther you move, the more opportunities you have to land on valuable properties, earn in-game currency, and trigger bonuses.

Without dice rolls, your progress in the game would be significantly slowed down. As a result, players often find themselves waiting for more dice rolls to become available, which can be frustrating, especially if youâ€™re on a winning streak or trying to land on specific spaces.

Now, let's look at some ways to maximize your dice rolls and keep the momentum going without spending money on in-app purchases.

1. Daily Rewards and Events: A Consistent Source of Free Dice Rolls
One of the easiest ways to get free dice rolls in Monopoly Go is by taking advantage of the Daily Rewards system. The game offers daily login bonuses to players who log in regularly. These rewards often include dice rolls, in-game currency, and other valuable items. The more days you log in consecutively, the better the rewards youâ€™ll receive.

How to Claim Your Daily Dice Rolls:
Open the Game Daily: Make sure to log into the game at least once every day.
Check the Daily Rewards Section: Look for the Daily Rewards tab or notification on your home screen.
Claim Your Dice Rolls: Each day, youâ€™ll be rewarded with free dice rolls as part of your daily bonus.
The longer you play, the more rewards you'll be able to claim, including significant amounts of dice rolls.

Pro Tip: Donâ€™t forget to log in during special events, as these often offer higher rewards, including extra dice rolls.
2. Participate in Special Events for Extra Dice Rolls
Monopoly Go regularly hosts special events and limited-time challenges. These events offer players the chance to earn extra dice rolls by completing specific objectives or missions. For instance, you may be asked to collect a certain number of properties, win specific mini-games, or simply log in every day for a few days in a row.

How to Get Dice Rolls from Events:
Keep an Eye on Event Announcements: The game often posts notifications about upcoming events. Be sure to check them out regularly.
Complete Event Tasks: Each event will have a set of objectives. By completing these, youâ€™ll earn various rewards, including dice rolls.
Claim Your Rewards on Time: Events usually have a time limit. Make sure to complete all objectives before the event ends so you can claim your rewards.
These special events are an excellent way to maximize your dice rolls without spending any money. Some events may even offer bonus rewards for completing specific milestones, like an extra roll for every 10 properties you acquire.

3. Leveling Up for Free Dice Rolls
In Monopoly Go, leveling up is a key way to unlock new features and rewards. As you advance through the game, youâ€™ll be rewarded with free dice rolls and other valuable items. These rewards are often tied to milestones, so be sure to level up as quickly as possible to claim your free rolls.

How to Level Up Faster:
Complete Tasks and Objectives: Each level comes with a set of tasks. Completing these tasks will reward you with experience points (XP) and other valuable resources.
Participate in Mini-Games: Mini-games can provide a significant amount of XP and dice rolls. Make sure to play them whenever theyâ€™re available.
Buy Property: Acquiring properties and completing sets will give you both XP and in-game money, which can help you level up.
Leveling up quickly is one of the most effective ways to keep a steady flow of dice rolls coming your way. Make sure youâ€™re consistently completing objectives and advancing through the game.

4. Using Free Dice Roll Generators
For those looking for a quick way to get free dice rolls, some third-party websites and apps offer dice roll generators. These tools are designed to give players access to unlimited dice rolls without having to wait or pay for them. However, itâ€™s important to be cautious when using these tools, as they can sometimes be unsafe and may violate the gameâ€™s terms of service.

Important Considerations Before Using Dice Roll Generators:
Trustworthy Sources: Only use reputable and trusted websites or apps that are known to offer safe and legitimate services.
Game Terms of Service: Be aware that using third-party generators may violate the gameâ€™s terms of service and could result in your account being banned. Always read the terms before using any third-party service.
Privacy Concerns: Make sure that the service youâ€™re using does not compromise your personal information or account security.
If you choose to use a dice roll generator, do so with caution and always prioritize your accountâ€™s safety.

5. Join a Monopoly Go Community for Tips and Free Offers
Another great way to get free dice rolls in Monopoly Go is by joining Monopoly Go communities on social media platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Discord. These communities often share tips, tricks, and links to free offers that can help you earn additional dice rolls. Many players also share special promo codes that you can redeem for free rolls and other in-game rewards.

How to Join a Monopoly Go Community:

6. Purchase Dice Rolls Using In-Game Currency
While this guide focuses on getting free dice rolls, itâ€™s also worth mentioning that Monopoly Go allows players to purchase additional dice rolls using in-game currency.
